# 📊 End-to-End Data Analysis Project

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end analysis simulating an E-commerce website scenario aimed at enhancing customer retention, optimizing conversion rates, and improving strategic decision-making through data-driven insights.

## 📌 Project Objective

To analyze customer behaviors and transaction patterns using Funnel Analysis and RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Segmentation, providing actionable insights for business strategies.

## 🔍 Key Deliverables

### ✅ Data Generation and Cleaning:

* **Synthetic Dataset Creation:** Generated realistic synthetic datasets (`customers`, `transactions`, `churn`, `session_events`) using ChatGPT.
* **Data Cleaning with PostgreSQL (PGAdmin):**

  * Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and corrected inconsistencies.
  * Advanced SQL techniques employed for comprehensive data validation and transformation.

### ✅ Advanced Data Exploration:

* **Python Exploratory Analysis:**

  * Conducted exploratory data analysis using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib).
  * Performed detailed feature engineering and statistical analysis.
* **Funnel Analysis:**

  * Visualized customer conversion rates across various interaction stages, identifying key drop-off points.
* **RFM Segmentation:**

  * Classified customers into distinct groups based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values to facilitate targeted marketing strategies.

### ✅ Dashboard & Visualization (Power BI):

* Developed interactive dashboards presenting critical KPIs:

  * Conversion Rates
  * Retention Rates
  * Customer Segments based on RFM scores
* Visualizations aid clear understanding and support data-driven decision-making.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

* **Data Management:** PostgreSQL (PGAdmin)
* **Data Analysis:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
* **Visualization:** Power BI Desktop (Free Version)
